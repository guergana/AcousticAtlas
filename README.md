This is the code for the `experience folder` from the Acoustic Atlas.

In the database you need to input the following data, paying close attention to the casing:

```
image:
image_credit:
image_link:
latitude: (*)
longitude: (*)
description:
IR_filename: (*)
IR_credit:

```

(\*) required fields, if these fields are not entered in the database the point will not render.
